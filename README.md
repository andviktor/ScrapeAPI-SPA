SaaS application ScrapeAPI is designed for automatic scraping of data from websites. 

Users can create any number of scrapers, connecting them up in chains (for example: one scraper collects links to product pages, and another follows the collected links and collects data from product pages). 

For each scraper, you can create an unlimited number of data elements that need to be obtained (for example: product name, description, parameters, price, images, etc.). 

The result of the scrapers' work is presented in JSON format and is available directly when accessing the service API from third-party applications (in addition, scrapers can also be launched).
